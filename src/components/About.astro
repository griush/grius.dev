    <p class="font-medium text-xl">
        My name is Gerard Rius. I was born and currently live in Barcelona, Spain. Computers and programming have been around me since I was a little kid.
        This is why, at the age of 10, started programming and I have loved doing so since. That led me to start my studies as a software engineer at UPC.
